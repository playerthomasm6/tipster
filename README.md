Here we have a webpage that accesses two local API's to give you a certain beer
based off certain aspects of the movie. Start of by typing in one of your favorite movies
and see what beer it'll be matched with.

Now, you're probably wondering how we managed to match a beer with a random movie; well here's
the secret. The beer is determined based off the movie's run time and the amount of vowels in the title. If you're a beer lover go ahead and try it out, if you dont like beer; come back in the future when Tipster 2.0 is out.
